## Security Shepherd Road Map
Security Shepherd wants to be as highly usable as we can achieve. Our primary objective is currently to achieve full language localisation support for the entire application. Currently we have covered the main pages users would interact with. We actively need volunteers to take part in the translation process. If you are interested in getting involved please check out our [GitHub Wiki](http://bit.ly/securityShepherdGithub) describing [How to Add a New Language to Security Shepherd](https://github.com/OWASP/SecurityShepherd/wiki/How-to-Create-a-Web-Shepherd-Level).  

Our long term goals are to cover as many web and mobile application security risks as possible. If you are interested in getting involved in adding levels to Security Shepherd, please check out our [GitHub Wiki](http://bit.ly/securityShepherdGithub) describing [How to Make a Security Shepherd Level](https://github.com/OWASP/SecurityShepherd/wiki/Adding-a-new-Language-to-Shepherd). For the Latest and Greatest short term goals. Please see the [issues page](https://github.com/OWASP/SecurityShepherd/issues) in our GitHub. We use ZenHub Boards to PM.
